- Calc GPA function
 "If the user clicks on the Calculate button, then you should call a JavaScript function called calcGPA() and calculate the GPA using the following information:

IS 201 is worth 30%

IS 303 or CS142 is worth 30%

ACC 200 is worth 5%

The overall GPA is worth 15%

The last 30 GPA credits is worth 20%"

 "Remember the following grade associations:
A = 4
A- = 3.7
B+ = 3.4
B = 3
B- = 2.7
C+ = 2.4
C = 2
C- = 1.7
D+ = 1.4
D = 1
D- = .7
E = 0
When the page is first displayed (or loaded) or if the user clicks on the RESET button, the IS201 drop down list should have focus.

When the user clicks on the RESET button you should call a JavaScript function called clearCircle() and clear the circle (style.display = "none" and style.fill = "none" for the element), clear the output GPA, clear the overall GPA and the last 30 credits GPA, reset all drop downs to A's and the checkboxes to false (empty), and then set focus to the IS202 drop down.
